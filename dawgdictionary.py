    DawgDictionary uses a Directed Acyclic Word Graph (DAWG) internally
    to store a large set of words in an efficient structure in terms
    of storage and speed.

    The graph is pre-built using the code in dawgbuilder.py and stored
    in a text-based file to be loaded at run-time by DawgDictionary.

    The main class supports three fundamental query functions:

    DawgDictionary.find(word)
        Returns True if the word is found in the dictionary, or False if not.
        The __contains__ operator is supported, so "'myword' in dawgdict" also works.

    DawgDictionary.find_matches(pattern)
        Returns a list of words that match the pattern. The pattern can contain
        wildcards ('?'). For example, result = dawgdict.find_matches("ex???") returns
        a list of all 5-letter words starting with "ex".

    DawgDictionary.find_permutations(rack)
        Returns a list of all permutations of the given rack, i.e. valid words
        consisting of one or more letters from the rack in various orders.
        The rack may contain wildcards ('?'). For example,
        result = dawgdict.find_permutations("se?")
        returns a list of all words from 1 to 3 characters that can be constructed from
        the letters "s" and "e" and any one additional letter.

    All of the above query functions are built on top of a generic DAWG navigation function:

    DawgDictionary.navigate(navigator)
        Uses a navigation object to control the traversal of the graph and tabulate
        results. The navigation object should implement a number of interface functions,
        as documented in comments for the navigate() function.

    DawgDictionary.FindNavigator(word)
        A navigation class to find words by exact match. Used by DawgDictionary.find()

    DawgDictionary.PermutationNavigator(rack, minlen)
        A navigation class to find rack permutations. Used by DawgDictionary.find_permutations()

    DawgDictionary.MatchNavigator(rack, minlen)
        A navigation class to find words matching a pattern. Used by DawgDictionary.find_matches()

    See also comments in dawgbuilder.py

    Test code for this module is found in dawgtester.py
