# Utility program to read a list of frequent
# Polish words from the file polish_frequent_words.txt,
# which are in descending order by frequency. Each
# line contains the frequency count as a number, followed
# by a space, and then the word in question.
# We want to read the file and output all valid words that
# are at least 3 characters long and no longer than 12 characters.
# We want to limit the output to N words, where N is a
# command-line parameter.
