    DawgBuilder uses a Directed Acyclic Word Graph (DAWG)
    to store a large set of words in an efficient structure in terms
    of storage and speed.

    The DAWG implementation is partially based on Steve Hanov's work
    (see http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=115), which references
    a paper by Daciuk et al (http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J00-1002.pdf).

    This implementation compresses node sequences with single edges between
    them into single multi-letter edges. It also removes redundant edges
    to "pure" final nodes.

    DawgBuilder reads a set of text input files containing plain words,
    one word per line, and outputs a text file with a compressed
    graph. This file is read by the DawgDictionary class; see
    dawgdictionary.py

    The output file is structured as a sequence of lines. Each line
    represents a node in the graph and contains information about
    outgoing edges from the node. Nodes are referred to by their
    line number, where the starting root node is in line 1 and subsequent
    nodes are numbered starting with 2.

    A node (line) is represented as follows:

    ['|']['_' prefix ':' nextnode]*

    If the node is a final node (i.e. a valid word is completed at
    the node), the first character in the line is
    a vertical bar ('|') followed by an underscore.
    The rest of the line is a sequence of edges where each edge
    is described by a prefix string followed by a colon (':')
    and the line number of the node following that edge. Edges are
    separated by underscores ('_'). The prefix string can contain
    embedded vertical bars indicating that the previous character was
    a final character in a valid word.

    Example:

    The following input word list (cf. http://tinyurl.com/kvhbyo2):

    car
    cars
    cat
    cats
    do
    dog
    dogs
    done
    ear
    ears
    eat
    eats

    generates this output graph:

    do:3_ca:2_ea:2
    t|s:0_r|s:0
    |_g|s:0_ne:0

    The root node in line 1 has three outgoing edges, "do" to node 3,
    "ca" to node 2, and "ea" to node 2.

    Node 2 (in line 2) has two edges, "t|s" to node 0 and "r|s" to node 0.
    This means that "cat" and "cats", "eat" and "eats" are valid words
    (on the first edge), as well as "car" and "cars", "ear" and "ears"
    (on the second edge).

    Node 3 (in line 3) is itself a final node, denoted by the vertical bar
    at the start of the line. Thus, "do" (coming in from the root) is a
    valid word, but so are "dog" and "dogs" (on the first edge) as well as
    "done" (on the second edge).

    Dictionary structure:

    Suppose the dictionary contains two words, 'word' and 'wolf'.
    This is represented by Python data structures as follows:

    root _Dawg -> {
        'w': _DawgNode(final=False, edges -> {
            'o': _DawgNode(final=False, edges -> {
                'r': _DawgNode(final=False, edges -> {
                    'd': _DawgNode(final=True, edges -> {})
                    }),
                'l': _DawgNode(final=False, edges -> {
                    'f': _DawgNode(final=True, edges -> {})
                    })
                })
            })
        }

    It contains:

            (following letter(s)) together with its child _DawgNode;

            also marks the end of a legal word.

    A _DawgNode has a string representation which can be hashed to
    determine whether it is identical to a previously encountered node,
    i.e. whether it has the same final flag and the same edges with
    prefixes leading to the same child nodes. This assumes
    that the child nodes have already been subjected to the same
    test, i.e. whether they are identical to previously encountered
    nodes and, in that case, modified to point to the previous, identical
    subgraph. Each graph layer can thus depend on the (shallow) comparisons
    made in previous layers and deep comparisons are not necessary. This
    is an important optimization when building the graph.
